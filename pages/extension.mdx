### Regular Firefox Tutorial

#### How to use CRX Installer with regular Firefox
Complete guide for disabling signature verification in standard Firefox

In the regular version of Firefox, setting `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` does not work correctly. This document explains how to disable this restriction.

1. **Identify the path of omni.ja**

   omni.ja is located in the Firefox installation directory.

   The typical path is as follows:
   ```
   C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/omni.ja
   C:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/omni.ja
   /Applications/Firefox.app/omni.ja
   /usr/lib/firefox/omni.ja
   /usr/lib64/firefox/omni.ja
   /opt/firefox/omni.ja
   ```

   You can also check the location of the installation directory from the `about:support` page.

2. **Patch omni.ja**

   Download [omniPatcher.py](moz-extension://4b8907c7-9352-42d6-b392-6692b947b0b7/docs/omniPatcher.py) and run it as follows:
   ```
   python omniPatcher.py /path/to/omni.ja
   ```

3. **Remove startup cache**

   To apply the changes, open `about:support` and delete the startup cache from the button at the top right.

   This allows you to disable signature verification in the regular version of Firefox based on the value of `xpinstall.signatures.required`.
